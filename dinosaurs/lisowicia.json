        "Despite its size, they are surprisingly mobile in the water. It spends much of its time near water sources to regulate body temperature and deter parasites.",
        "Its social structure revolves around small, tight-knit pods, usually led by a dominant individual. These groups often engage in communal care, with multiple adults working together to shield juveniles from threats.",
        "Their deep, guttural bellows serve as both warnings to rivals and a means of maintaining contact within the herd, carrying across great distances in open environments.",
        "During mating seasons, males engage in ritualistic clashes, using their beaks and bulk to push rivals aside. The victors gain access to prime grazing areas and potential mates.",
        "These voracious eaters aren’t picky—they’ll make a meal out of whatever they can find, allowing them to thrive in a variety of environments."
